E-ATM

This simple project will essentially create a simulation of an ATM within a Windows Console App. Just like an ATM, the program should have at least the following features:

Check whether an input â€“ card number - is recorded correctly.
Verifying user by asking for a PIN number.
In case of negative verification, logging out user.
In case of positive verification, showing three options : check account balance, cash withdrawal and exit.
Give user ability to withdraw up to $1000 worth of cash in one transaction with total transactions limited to 3 per day.
